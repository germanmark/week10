# week10
This is a repository for the in-class exercises done during week 10 (JavaScript DOM and cookies)

I have added comments to explain some of the things we used to enable the functionality on the various pages we implemented. 
Take time to read the comments on both the code and the html.

Note that the functions are commented using a special commenting mechanism known as JSDoc (https://jsdoc.app/), which is what allows your VSCode to display more information when you hover a function you are calling.
